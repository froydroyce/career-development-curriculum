# Agile & Feedback Reflection Guidelines
In interviews, you'll be asked about how you approach working in projects, and being able to describe how you utilize agile processes is a great way to help you stand out as a junior developer candidate. This reflection is meant to help you develop this skill.

With that in mind, please answer the following questions in your own gist about your group project:

1. What have you learned about the use of agile vs. waterfall in software projects? 

* Using the agile model allows you to learn logic together as you progress through the project, being able to learn from your mistakes early on. While initially trying to use the waterfall model, our group ended up lost and not "on the same page". 

2. How did you and your group approach project management in this project (what tools did you use, how did you hold each other accountable, etc.)?

* Initially we tried to divide up each iteration to a group member, but we quickly realized we were'nt making progress taking that route. We re-DTR'd and decided to devide up each methods in each iteration. We made much better progress this way in the beginning, but towards the end up the project, some group members were not able to hold their own weight. This caused to not finish our project, loss of sleep, and a lot of frustration. 

3. What role did you take on in the project? 
* I took on the role of keeping the group optimistic and refactoring our code.

4. What changes would you make to your approach in future team projects?
-Take on agile model from the start. Also make sure there are frequent commits and pull requests from every group member to make sure code is actually being written. 

5. How does retro function in a team project?
* Talk about what went well, what went wrong, and what actions were going to take.

6. In your team retro, how did you engage in the feedback process? What principles of feedback did you use in these conversations?

7. How would you describe your ability to communicate feedback? How has this experience affected your communication skills? How do you want to improve in your ability to communicate feedback?
